# phantom-request

## Overview

The **goal** of `phantom-request` is to simplify making API requests with minimal code. This package allows you to make HTTP requests in a single line of code, leveraging the power of **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**. It is designed for developers who want to quickly perform requests with built-in support for things like token management, headers, and parametersâ€”without worrying about boilerplate code like handling `useEffect` for data fetching (though it can be used for more control).

## Installation

Install the package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install phantom-request
```

or

```bash
yarn add phantom-request
```

**Important:** `phantom-request` uses React hooks under the hood, so be mindful not to violate the rules of hooks in React. This means hooks should not be called conditionally or inside loops, and they should always be called at the top level of your components or custom hooks. For proper usage, avoid using it in places where React hooks are not allowed.
